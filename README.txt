This git project was created shortly after updating to MPLAB 6.25, and then discovering that the PicKit 3 could no longer be used, therefore switching to PicKit4. The initial commit is the first working version with the simpler microcontroller, dsPIC33CH128MP502. It uses both cores of the MCU.

Future versions will switch to the dsPIC33CH256MP505T.
